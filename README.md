# No More Backlogs

Many video game consumers have a habit of buying video games on release, spending large amounts of cash but never really getting to play the game they spent $$$s on, creating a backlog. It's often observed that video games with poor reviews tend to rapidly become cheaper, so if users were to wait only a couple of weeks or months, they would be spending a fraction of the release price while ensuring zero or minimal backlog of games they want to play.

No More Backlogs predicts how the price of a video game decays over time based on initial and release day reviews and excitement. It provides a user frienly interface where gamers can enter it how long they would like to wait, or the price point of a game they are interested in, and the app will let them know the best times to buy it, or the price points they may get the game for.
